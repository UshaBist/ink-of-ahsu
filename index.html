    <p>
      I am Usha, of the Bist lineage, an undergraduate civil engineering student at the Institute of Engineering, Thapathali Campus,  
      yet my heart wanders beyond structures and blueprints. I fill my days with dance, painting, poetry, and small joyful creations.  
      I am curious, light-hearted, and full of wonder; a selfless spirit carrying emotions, love, and laughter wherever I go.  
      Every moment is a canvas, every smile a story, every thought a little burst of joy. This website is my own creation —  
      a bridge between the world of concrete and the world of words.
