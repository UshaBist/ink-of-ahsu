    <h2>      A LETTER TO MY SON 


 </h2>

    <p>
I was 20 when i conceived you and held your for the first<br>
My mewling baby, you were more than enough to quench my thirst<br>
Holding you felt like, grasping the whole world<br>
You were molten liquid, and i turned to be your mould <br><br>

I kept my ambitions and urges aside, to raise you<br>
I kept ownself in gloom, to lighten your future and to praise you<br>
I chose to live in fetor so that i could offer you aroma<br>
I cuddled all the sorrows so that i could surround you with just chroma<br><br>

I still remember those golden days, when i hadn't turned gray <br>
And that fortunate time, when i used to be included in your pray<br>
Remembrance of your giggles are yet enough to make my day<br><br>

But.. my questionnnnn<br>
My question remains still unanswered <br><br>

I failed sprinkling etiquettes on you is the cause for whatever happened today??<br><br>

I could have huddled up, If i was occupying more space over there<br>
I could have shut my voice, If everything i used to utter were proven ill-fated there<br><br>

Tell me..tell me<br>
Where did i go wrong dearie?<br>
Nothing was i doing except blessing you merely...<br>
What should i do with this empty lap now?<br>
Whom shall i refer this old heart to?<br><br>

I am sorry, my dear son <br>
But, somethings i feel like ,If you were not grown up...<br>
you would be my little kid fluttering, vibing and thriving around me filling my life with your joys<br><br>

But how could a mother be mean?<br>
I am happy...happy with your decision<br>
But i am afraid too<br>
That your old age will be soon knocking at your doorsüö™ <br>
And you..you may have to write a letter like this.<br><br>
